      <description>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behavior results from the interaction of bottom-up sensory processing and top-down executive control. At short timescales, neural activity underlying this interaction is regulated by learning and homeostatic mechanisms, which are mediated through synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. At a much longer timescale, arching from cognitive development to aging, neural activity is strongly influenced by changes in brain anatomy and functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies that analyze behavioral flexibility throughout this hierarchy of timescales are rare. This line of research utilizes a rule-based decision task and combines experimental procedures (psychophysics and neuroimaging) with computational approaches (reinforcement learning and neural circuit modeling) to encompass the dynamics, rise and decline of goal-directed behavior in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
